# Unit 17 Nosql Homework: Workout Tracker

For this assignment I created a workout tracker. This assignment required us to create Mongo database with a Mongoose schema and handle routes with Express. This application is to view create and track daily workouts with the ability to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. 

 I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
